# BAC4 Standalone - Interactive C4 Modelling Tool

An interactive web-based C4 modelling tool built with React that allows architects to create, edit, and visualise C4 diagrams with full interactivity. **Runs completely standalone in any browser - no server, no installation, no dependencies!**

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Ready to use immediately:**

1. Download `bac4-standalone.html`
2. Double-click to open it in any browser
3. Start creating C4 diagrams!

**That's it!** The ~477KB file contains everything you need and works entirely offline.

## Features

### Core Functionality

- **Interactive Canvas**: Drag-and-drop interface for adding and positioning elements
- **Pan and Zoom**: Navigate large diagrams easily with mouse controls
- **Visual Distinction**: Different colours and icons for each element type
- **Connection Lines**: Auto-routing relationship lines between elements
- **Click-to-Edit**: Click any element to edit its properties inline
- **Level-Aware Toolbar**: Shows only relevant element types for current C4 level

### C4 Level Support

- **Context Level**: Shows systems, people, and external systems
- **Container Level**: Shows systems, containers, people, and external systems
- **Component Level**: Shows containers, components, and people
- **Code Level**: Shows components only
- Adding elements preserves the active diagram's level
- Header text shows the active diagram level

### Element Management

- **Add Elements**: Toolbar shows context-appropriate buttons:
  - 🟦 Software System
  - 🟢 Container
  - 🟨 Component
  - 🟣 Person
  - ⚪ External System
- **Edit Properties**: Name, description, technology, tags, position
- **Create Relationships**: Drag between elements to create connections
- **Delete Elements**: With confirmation dialogue (auto-removes orphaned relationships)

### Multi-Diagram Workspaces

- Elements and relationships are shared records; each diagram owns ordered memberships and its members' positions.
- The active diagram is projected onto the canvas, so switching restores independent geometry while shared semantic edits remain visible everywhere.
- BAC4 JSON saves the complete workspace; diagram export formats use the active projection.

### Diagram Management

The toolbar lists **Diagrams** before **Elements**, while **Elements** remains the default panel. Add Diagram creates and selects a default-named diagram at the current level. Select a row to switch by stable ID; duplicate names remain independent. Delete confirms before removing a diagram and only garbage-collects records no remaining diagram references.

### Model Persistence

- **Export Formats**:
  - JSON (full model data)
  - Structurizr JSON (workspace format)
  - PlantUML C4 syntax
  - Mermaid C4 syntax
  - Markdown documentation
  - HTML standalone document
  - PNG image
  - SVG image
  - Draw.io (.drawio) for diagrams.net
- **Import**: Load previously exported JSON models (BAC4 or Structurizr format)
- **Local Storage Auto-save**: Automatically saves every 30 seconds + on page close

### Auto-Layout

Four intelligent layout algorithms:
- **Hierarchical**: Arranges elements in layers by type (best for C4 hierarchy)
- **Grid**: Organises elements in a uniform grid
- **Circular**: Arranges elements in a circle (best for showing connections)
- **Force-Directed**: Physics simulation to minimise overlap

### Relationship Customisation

- **Arrow Direction**: Left (←), Right (→), Both (↔), None (—)
- **Line Style**: Solid, Dashed, Dotted
- **Description**: Custom text for each relationship
- **Technology/Protocol**: Document communication methods (REST, gRPC, etc.)

## Usage Guide

### Adding Elements

1. **Check Current Level**: Look at the toolbar - it shows "Context Level", "Container Level", etc.
2. **Click Element Button**: Choose from available element types (toolbar shows only relevant options)
3. **Element Appears**: Added to the active diagram
4. **Position Element**: Drag to desired location

### Creating Relationships

1. **Hover Over Element**: Connection handles appear on all sides
2. **Click and Drag**: From one element's handle to another element
3. **Release**: Relationship arrow appears with default description
4. **Edit Relationship**: Click the arrow to modify description/technology

### Editing Properties

1. **Click Element**: Right panel shows properties
2. **Edit Fields**: Name, technology, description, tags
3. **Auto-save**: Changes save automatically when you tab out
4. **Delete**: Use delete button with confirmation

### Arranging Your Diagram

**Manual:**
- Drag elements to position them precisely
- Position info shows in the properties panel

**Automatic:**
- Click "Layout" in the header
- Choose algorithm:
  - Hierarchical (recommended for C4)
  - Grid (for uniform spacing)
  - Circular (for relationship emphasis)
  - Force-Directed (for organic layout)

### Exporting Your Work

1. **Click "Export"** in header
2. **Choose Format**:
   - **JSON (BAC4)**: Save your work to re-import later
   - **Structurizr JSON**: Export to Structurizr workspace format
   - **PlantUML**: Generate C4-PlantUML code
   - **Mermaid**: Generate Mermaid C4 diagram syntax
   - **Markdown**: Create documentation
   - **HTML**: Standalone document with embedded model
   - **PNG**: Raster image for presentations
   - **SVG**: Vector image for scaling
   - **Draw.io**: Open in diagrams.net for further editing
3. **File Downloads**: Automatically with descriptive name

### Working with Diagrams and Levels

The C4 model has 4 abstraction levels. Use **Add Diagram** in the toolbar to create and select a diagram at a level; the header mirrors the selected diagram's level.

| Level | Purpose | Shows |
|-------|---------|-------|
| **Context** | System landscape | Systems, People, External Systems |
| **Container** | System decomposition | + Containers |
| **Component** | Container internals | Containers, Components, People |
| **Code** | Implementation detail | Components only |

**Tip:** The Elements toolbar shows only relevant element types for the active diagram's level.

## Best Practices

### Diagram Organisation

1. **Context Diagrams**: Keep to 5-9 systems maximum for clarity
2. **Container Diagrams**: Focus on one system at a time
3. **Component Diagrams**: Show major structural components, not every class
4. **Code Diagrams**: Use sparingly, only for complex areas

### Element Naming

- Use clear, business-focused names (not technical jargon)
- Include technology stack in the technology field, not the name
- Keep descriptions concise (1-2 sentences)
- Use consistent naming conventions across diagrams

### Relationship Documentation

- Always add meaningful descriptions ("sends email to", not just "uses")
- Specify protocols/technologies where relevant (REST, gRPC, etc.)
- Use animated lines to indicate asynchronous communication

### Version Control

- Export models as JSON regularly (use version in filename)
- Commit JSON files to your repository
- Include generated PlantUML/Markdown in commits
- Tag major diagram versions
- Use descriptive commit messages

## Troubleshooting

### Elements Not Appearing

**Issue**: Clicked the toolbar button, but nothing shows onthe  canvas
**Solution**: Check the level dropdown - you might be at the wrong C4 level. The app auto-switches levels now, but older sessions might need manual switching.

### Canvas Not Responding

**Issue**: Can't drag, zoom, or click elements
**Solution**:
1. Refresh the page
2. Check browser console (F12) for errors
3. Clear local storage if data seems corrupted

### Export Not Working

**Issue**: Export button doesn't download the file
**Solution**:
1. Disable pop-up blocker
2. Check browser download permissions
3. Try a different export format
4. Check the browser console for errors

### Elements Overlapping

**Issue**: Too many elements in the same spot
**Solution**:
1. Use auto-layout (Layout → Hierarchical)
2. Manually drag elements apart
3. Zoom out for a better overview
4. Consider splitting into multiple diagrams

### Performance Issues

**Issue**: Slow rendering or lag
**Solution**:
1. Keep diagrams under 50 elements
2. Split large models into multiple C4 levels
3. Use level filtering (show only what's needed)
4. Avoid excessive relationships
5. Try simpler auto-layout (Grid instead of Force-Directed)

### Local Storage Full

**Issue**: "Quota exceeded" error
**Solution**:
1. Export model as JSON first (backup!)
2. Clear browser local storage
3. Re-import the JSON
4. Consider exporting more frequently
